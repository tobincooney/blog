RULES
=====

- First three lines of post file must contain a description, the date (YYYY.MM.DD), and the title, respectively

- First line of `deck.htm` must be the title of the deck page

- add `class="titular"` to an `<img>` tag to make it show up in the deck page
	- this image tag must be the only thing on that line of the post file

- the site is built in `/blog/`, and media files are in `/media/`, therefore you will need to write `../media/path-to-file.ext` to reference media files in post files (ex. `<img src="../media/beans.jpg" />`)
